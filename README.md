# Langr

Are you tired of using flash cards and flash card apps? You found that they are not as efficient as you would like and are kind of boring? Do you remember what you have learned when flipping through the material, but not when you are trying to use it in a real-life situation?  
Langr comes to your aid!   

Create custom, effective and fun lessons for yourselfs an others in a flash! 

*The features below are the target features for v1.0*
## Features:  
### For those wishing to learn:  

-Fully customizeable   

Some apps allow you to download full lectures to learn a new language, with a gamified learning system. Others allow you to create a couple types of flash cards for yourself. Why not have the best of both worlds?  

-Free-form answers for better retention  
Flash cards may be good for simple topics, but the fall short for more complex issues. Maybe you have to memorize words with complicated spelling, maybe you need to remember how to draw a graph, or perhaps you need to learn a couple of words for that Chinese or Japanese business trip. In these cases actually writing down or drawing the answer is more efficient then just thinking about it and checking the answer. This allows you to use the same brain areas you would use in a live situation, reducing the chance that you only thought that you knew the answer while practicing. You can choose between free-form text, drawing, multiple-choice with one or more answers and more to come.    

-Auto-completing and auto-expanding vocabulary  
If you are learning a language and have a dictionary file, you can use that as a basis for a lesson that you create, allowing you to quickly add words to your lesson. You can also let the system auto add compound words based on what you have already know. Most useful for languages like Japanese of chinese. For example if you have already learned 技　and 術 you probably want to learn what 技術　means.

-Intelligent practice system  
By intelligently sorting and organizing words the system takes care of not only randomizing the words, but also allowing you to focus on the areas you are not performing well on yet!  
  
-Share the exerience  
Do you think your peers could benefit from what you have created? Share the lesson you have created with your friends or with everyone on the platform.  
  
-Integrated Forum (TBD) and you are in control  
Do you think the answer on a question is wrong? Check on the forum what others think about it. You can always override the answer for your version of the lesson, no need to wait for approval.  
  
### For those wishing to teach:
-No programming skill required  
Create complete lessons easily without any programming knowledge thanks to our easy-to-use interface.  

-Have students  
You can choose to share your lesson with specific users, in which case you can track how each of your students are doing and if they override an answer, allowing you to quickly correct them and go to their aid.
